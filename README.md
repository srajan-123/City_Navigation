# City_Navigation and Driver Management System

This project provides a system for representing cities as graphs, where nodes represent locations and edges represent routes between them. Additionally, it includes a mechanism for managing driver information associated with each city. This system can be used for applications like ride-sharing or cab services.

Major algorithms used-
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Used for finding the shortest path between nodes in the graph.
Prim's Algorithm: Used for constructing the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph.

hey this is srajan
